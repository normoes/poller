This is a project to familiarize with hashes.

This is just another poller (not yet ready to use), which uses MD5 hashes of folders and files in order to track changes in the directories.
Currently it just actively walks through the given directory...


Of course, there is pyinotify and in the end, I think, I will implemenet this and Windows hooks as well.
